# Video Particle Visualization

A real-time video particle visualization system that converts video input into an interactive 3D point cloud visualization.

## Current Implementation

The current version uses p5.js for rendering and implements the following features:

- Real-time video processing that converts each frame into 3D particles
- Interactive controls for:
  - Spread (X, Y, Z): Controls particle dispersion in 3D space
  - Height Multiplier: Extends particles along the Z-axis (1-500 units)
  - Height Spacing: Places points at intervals along the Z-axis
  - Particle Size: Controls the size of individual points
  - Sampling: Controls how many pixels to skip when sampling the video

### Technical Details

The visualization pipeline works as follows:
1. Video frames are captured and processed using HTML5 video and canvas
2. Each pixel is sampled based on the sampling rate
3. For each sampled pixel:
   - Position is calculated with random spread in X, Y, Z
   - If height multiplier > 1, multiple points are generated along the Z-axis
   - Points are spaced according to the height spacing parameter
4. Rendering is done using p5.js point() and line() functions

### Performance Limitations

The current implementation has significant performance limitations:
- CPU-bound rendering using p5.js becomes slow with large height multipliers
- Each point is drawn individually, causing high draw call overhead
- JavaScript-based pixel processing is computationally expensive
- Performance degrades significantly when:
  - Height multiplier is increased (>50)
  - Height spacing is decreased (<5)
  - Sampling rate is decreased (more pixels processed)
- Not suitable for lower-end computers due to heavy CPU usage

## Planned Improvements

The next version will address these performance issues through:
1. Migration to WebGL using Three.js for GPU-accelerated rendering
2. Instanced mesh rendering for particles
3. Shader-based video processing
4. Optimized geometry and buffer management
5. Hardware-accelerated point cloud rendering

## Setup and Usage

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the server:
```bash
python server.py
```

3. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

## Controls

- Use mouse to rotate the view
- Adjust sliders to control visualization parameters
- Video playback controls are available below the visualization

## Requirements

- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- Python 3.x for the server
- Sufficient CPU/GPU power for real-time processing
